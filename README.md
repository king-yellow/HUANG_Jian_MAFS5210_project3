## Abstract
This research proposed a really profitable novel statistical speculation strategy called Differential Trend Motion strategy. 
This paper investigated this strategy performance of three stock indexes: S&P500, HSI and CSI500. 
By using the training data to select the optimal strategy and moving average order based on maximum profit, 
excess profit and information ratio, the return and sharp ratio of strategy outperformed benchmark (buy and hold strategy) in testing set. 
This research not only showed the robust of strategy but also refuted the weak efficient market hypothesis 
by proving the long-term data may be valuable in construction of target or reference price (called standard line in this paper) 
of future transactions.
